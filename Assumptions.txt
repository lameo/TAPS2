Assumptions

Individual_model
- There is only 2 gender type in the case study
- There is only 3 occupation type in this case study 
- There is only 6 different marital status according to https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/standards_and_classifications/scms.pdf
- The spouse field will just contain the name
- individual names are considered unique in this case study since there isn't the NRIC field

Housing_type
- There is at least 3 HousingType (Possible options: Landed, Condominium, HDB), but this is non-exhaustive

Filtering results
- Age of the person will be considered up to the exact date, ie the person will only be 1 year older when it 
  pass their birthday itself, not on the 1st Jan.
- If 2 individuals in the same household have each other name as spouse, they will be considered as
  1 married family

Overall 
- GET will be only be used for data retrieval operation only, POST will only be used for creation, update
- In the event GET method is included in data creation/update methods, it is to facilate the django 
  GUI panel functionality, the GET function itself is nonfunctional.
